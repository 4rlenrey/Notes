## What is a computer
---

Computer is just a machine that can do some operations automatically.
Some people think that abacus was the first computer to ever exist. For me the first actual computer was Turing's Machine.

### Personal Computer

PC in short is a computer made with focus on ability of interacting with a normal user rather than some sort of a computer expert.
Because it's made that way almost all the modern PC's comes with some sort of OS and some basic computer programs.
That's to make it easier for an average user to interact with this type of machine.

### Components

Most of modern PC's are built out of a lot of components and peripheral devices.
To be able to use your PC your components should be compatible.

#### CPU 

Central Processing Unit often referred as processor is responsible for executing instructions.

It's main three components are
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Registers
- Control unit

#### GPU

Graphical Processing Unit is designed to create images in frame buffer so that it can be displayed on something.

#### Power supply unit

PSU converts the power grid to regulated DC power. It basically powers all the components.
Some of them contain a switch that allows you to turn it on and off.

#### RAM

Random-Access Memory is mostly just temporarily storing data and machine code. It allows you to access this data a lot faster than some Hard disks etc.

#### Data storage device

On this components your data is stored even if you turn off your PC (Unlike RAM).

There are two common types of data storage devices:
- Hard disk drive (HDD): It's essentially just a metal platter with a magnetic coating and a read-write head. 

- Solid state drive (SSD): It's typically using flash memory to store data on.


#### Motherboard 

It grants other components communication.

It most commonly consists of:
- CPU socket
- Chipset
- Clock
- Flash ROM
- Memory slots
- Expansion cards slots
- Power connectors
- SATA/NVMe

#### Cooling

Because other components produce heat they need to be cooled down.
There are a few ways to do this.
I think that heatsinks with a fan and heat pipes are the most commonly used for this.

#### Case

It's like a bag for all the components. It's main purpose is to wrap everything up so you don't have a lot of high voltage components lying around. You don't really need it but it's really useful. I know a guy who don't have it because he put all of his PC's parts inside of his desk.

There's a thing called **`Case modding`** and it's really cool. I recommend checking it out!

### Peripheral Devices

Most commonly referred as Output/Input devices. Without them you wouldn't really be able to use a computer because they allow you to interact with it.

#### Monitor 

A device that allows you to display an image.

Funny thing is that according to some leaked NSA document there's a possibility that if NSA would want to know what you're doing on your computer
they'll swap your cable with some bugged one that would allow them to see what you're doing. 

#### Mouse 

I don't like using it. Keyboard is just better.

#### Keyboard

It's a input device with a lot of buttons. Every letter and number has a button representing it.
