		<h2>Solid base and terminology</h2>
		<p>
			Cybersecurity is trying to acheve all of above goals for data and services:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<dt>Avaliability</dt>
				<dd><i>You should be able to use your bank account</i></dd>
			</li>
			<li>
				<dt>Integrity</dt>
				<dd><i>Your bully should not be able to change your name</i></dd>

			</li>
			<li>
				<dt>Accountability</dt>
				<dd><i>Your bully should not be able to take credit for your work</i></dd>

			</li>
			<li>
				<dt>Confidentialiy</dt>
				<dd><i>Your friends should not be able to see your divorce papers</i></dd>

			</li>
			<li>
				<dt>Authenticity</dt>
				<dd><i>You should be able to get the real amount of money stored in your PayPal</i></dd>

			</li>
		</ul>
		There are two base types of attacks.
		<ul>
			<li>
				<dt>Passive attack</dt>
				<dd><i>Attacker just gets some information without harming system resources</i></dd>
				<dd>- Really hard to detect</dd>
			</li>
			<li>
				<dt>Active attack</dt>
				<dd><i>Attcker does something to the system resources</i></dd>
				<dd>- Easier to detect</dd>
			</li>
		</ul>
		There's another way of separating attacks into two categories;
		<ul>
			<li>
				<dt>Internal attack</dt>
				<dd><i>Attacker is a imposter</i></dd>
			</li>
			<li>
				<dt>External attack</dt>
				<dd><i>Attcker is not from the company/system</i></dd>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
