        <h2>Read before using</h2>
        Do not use it if you want to get good by reading it! I am pretty sure that skill comes mostly with practice. This note making process was my way of practice :). This is not a place where beginner coders learn it's just a
        collection of my notes.
        I'm not a proffesional writer nor a teacher nor native english speaker, so so it might contain some false
        information, bad coding practice and english grammar issues.

    <div id="about" class="Section">
        <h2>What is this thing?</h2>
        <p>
            This is a digital version of my notes. I've made them based on a bit of books, articles and videos. Every
            single word in here is written by me.
            I used HTML and some CSS to make it somehow readable. (I'm not a graphic designer nor a front end developer
            so please don't judge me).
            I'm doing it to be able to have a solid copy of my learning mindset for when I'm not gonna be able to
            remember something from here. <small>(Also I had some internet issues and had access only to some
                programming books and got a bit bored)</small>
            For now you can't really contribute to this but if you want to point out some misspelling/grammar issues
            feel free to contact me.
