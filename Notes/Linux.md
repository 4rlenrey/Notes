## History and Overview
---

A Finnish guy named Linus Torvalds was a bit frustrated about licensing of MINIX and created his kernel. The fun fact is that initially it was supposed to be named Freax.
His coworker thought that Linux suits better and he named a project like this.


## Task management
---

I've just learned, that you can background a task and redirect a output stream to null by doing this:

``` sh
./run_something &> /dev/null
```

Isn't it cool?
