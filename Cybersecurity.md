## Solid base and terminology
---

Cybersecurity is trying to achieve all of above goals for data and services:

* Availability - _You should be able to use your bank account_
* Integrity - _Your bully should not be able to change your name_
* Accountability - _Your bully should not be able to take credit for your work_
* Confidentiality - _Your friends should not be able to see your divorce papers_
* Authenticity - _You should be able to get the real amount of money stored in your PayPal_
    

There are two base types of attacks.

* Passive attack _Attacker just gets some information without harming system resources (Really hard to detect)_ 
* Active attack _Attacker does something to the system resources (Easier to detect)_
    

There's another way of separating attacks into two categories;

* Internal attack _Attacker is an imposter_
* External attack _Attacker is not from the company/system_
