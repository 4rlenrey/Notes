## Read before using
---

Do not use it if you want to get good by reading it! I am pretty sure that skill comes mostly with practice. This note making process was my way of practice :). This is not a place where beginner coders learn. It's just a collection of my notes. I'm not a professional writer nor a teacher nor native english speaker, so it might contain some false information, bad coding practice and english grammar issues.

## What is this thing?
---

This is a digital version of my notes. I've made them based on a bit of books, articles and videos. Every single word in here is written by me. I used HTML and some CSS to make it somehow readable. (I'm not a graphic designer nor a front end developer so please don't judge me). I'm doing it to be able to have a solid copy of my learning mindset for when I'm not gonna be able to remember something from here. (Also I had some internet issues and had access only to some programming books and got a bit bored) For now you can't really contribute to this but if you want to point out some misspelling/grammar issues feel free to contact me.
