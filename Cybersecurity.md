## Solid base and terminology
---

Cybersecurity is trying to acheve all of above goals for data and services:

* Avaliability
    
    _You should be able to use your bank account_
    
* Integrity
    
    _Your bully should not be able to change your name_
    
* Accountability
    
    _Your bully should not be able to take credit for your work_
    
* Confidentialiy
    
    _Your friends should not be able to see your divorce papers_
    
* Authenticity
    
    _You should be able to get the real amount of money stored in your PayPal_
    

There are two base types of attacks.

* Passive attack
    
    _Attacker just gets some information without harming system resources_
    
    \- Really hard to detect
    
* Active attack
    
    _Attcker does something to the system resources_
    
    \- Easier to detect
    

There's another way of separating attacks into two categories;

* Internal attack
    
    _Attacker is a imposter_
    
* External attack
    
    _Attcker is not from the company/system_
